Anomalib is a deep learning library that aims to collect state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms for benchmarking on both public and private datasets. 
Anomalib provides several ready-to-use implementations of anomaly detection algorithms described in the recent literature, as well as a set of tools that facilitate the development and implementation of custom models. 
The library has a strong focus on image-based anomaly detection, where the goal of the algorithm is to identify anomalous images, or anomalous pixel regions within images in a dataset. 
Anomalib is constantly updated with new algorithms and training/inference extensions, so keep checking!
